A redo of chapter 8 and 9
What have an IOrderRepository? I thought this was an Interface and it was just a contract. This has been confusing because the interface holds data.
What is the difference bewteen migration and update data base? Are they both meant to update the whole database in 2 steps?
What does AddTransient do?
Again, what is the Dbset<Orders> do in the ApplicationsDbCOntext?
